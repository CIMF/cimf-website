## Daniel Shapiro

Daniel Shapiro continues to gain recognition as a leading interpreter of Schubert, Mozart, Schumann, Brahms, and Beethoven—whose thirty-two sonata cycle he has twice performed, and whose live performances of all the sonatas can be found on Youtube—and as a teacher and coach at the Cleveland Institute of Music. He has given critically acclaimed performances across the United States, in Brazil, Britain, Ireland, Spain, France, Italy, Korea, China, at the Amsterdam Concertgebouw and at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.  His CD of Beethoven’s “Diabelli” Variations and his DVDs of Schubert piano sonatas have received enthusiastic reviews. 
 
Shapiro has performed extensively with orchestras, including the National Symphony, the Sâo Paulo State Symphony Orchestra, the Academy of London, the Knoxville Symphony and the Los Angeles Debut Orchestra. He regularly performs Mozart concertos with the Mozart Classical Orchestra in California. He was a top prize winner of the William Kapell International Piano Competition, and also won the American Pianists’ Association Beethoven Fellowship Award.
 
As a chamber musician, Shapiro has performed regularly with members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Chicago Symphony and Cleveland Orchestras, and has also performed with the Cavani, Mirò and Linden Quartets. He has participated at the Marlboro and Ravinia Festivals and the Fellowship Program at Tanglewood. He has released chamber music compact discs on the Harmonia Mundi and ASV labels.
 
He has studied conducting since the age of fourteen, and has studied with Daniel Lewis, Victor Yampolsky, Fritz Zweig, and Gustav Meier. He made his conducting debut at sixteen at Tanglewood, and conducted Mozart’s Don Giovanni with the Akron Lyric Opera. His musicianship has been enhanced and deepened by extensive experience as a collaborator and coach in art song and opera; listening to and working with singers have continually been a source of tremendous inspiration. He studied with Gwendolyn Koldofsky and Natalie Limonick, and was an opera and art song coach at UCLA.  

A native of southern California, he began the study of piano at the age of six. His teachers have included Leon Fleisher, John Perry, Russell Sherman, Joanna Graudan, and Reginald Stewart. He studied at the University of Southern California and at the Peabody Conservatory, where he received his doctorate. 
 
Before joining the Cleveland Institute of Music he was on the piano faculty of the University of Iowa. He has given master classes in several of the leading conservatories in Korea, China and Hong Kong. He has also taught and given master classes at many summer music festivals across the U.S., Canada and Italy.
