He has performed in opera, oratorio and recital throughout the United States and Europe, including Carnegie Hall's Weill Recital Hall in New York, Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto, Italy.
After graduating from Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, he earned master’s degrees in piano performance from the University of Missouri and in voice performance from the University of Akron. He holds the Doctor of Musical Arts degree in voice performance at the Cleveland Institute of Music.
