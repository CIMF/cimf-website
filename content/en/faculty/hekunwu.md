## Hekun Wu

Regarded as “a globe-trotter virtuoso, one of the most recognized Chinese musicians in the world” (Nice-Matin, France), Hekun Wu enjoys a versatile career as a concert cellist and conductor, capturing audiences with his exceptional tonal beauty and his “bold and very full of conviction… unusually supple and beautiful” interpretation (The Boston Globe). Currently the principal guest conductor of Zhejiang Symphony Orchestra, he has served as music director of the Salem Chamber Orchestra, and resident conductor of the Icicle Creek Music Festival and Montecito Festival in the U.S.  

Concerts and music festivals have taken him to Austria, France, Germany, Italy, U.S., and his native China, in such cities as Shanghai, Paris, New York, Boston, Nice, Leipzig and Taipei.  He has been featured on radio and television broadcasts worldwide. Wu gave the first Chinese performances of the Milhaud and Elgar cello concertos, as well as Penderecki’s Concerto Grosso with the composer on the podium. He made his European début with the Orchestre de Bordeaux-Aquitaine under Pierre Dervaux, and held his Cello Concerti Concert in the Shanghai Grand Theatre celebrating the new Millennium. His Tao of Bach project – recital and recording of the Bach Six Solo Suites (MSRClassics) won him critical acclaim, “Wu captures the essence of the dance in every one of the movements. He’s light on the bow and his phrasing traces arcs and pirouettes of the dancer in motion. In a word, his playing is airborne. … I wouldn’t want to be without the versions by Queyras, Hekun Wu, Casals and János Starker.” (Fanfare) 
 
Recent appearances include recitals in Paris at the Eglise Américaine and the Cité Internationale des Arts as an Artist-in-residence; a recital opening the Abbey Bach Festival in Oregon; in New York under the auspices of the Korea Music Foundation; and a televised recital from the Shanghai Concert Hall. Equally at home on the podium, Wu has given the Pacific Northwest premieres of Ned Rorem’s opera, Our Town and Tan Dun’s Pipa Concerto.  He also often appears as conductor-soloist; recently with orchestras in Shanghai, Xiamen, Chongqing and Hangzhou. 

Born and educated in Shanghai and later at the Paris Conservatoire, Wu completed his graduate studies in the U.S. at Boston University and the University of Minnesota. He was a recipient of Cello and Conducting Fellowships from the Aspen Music Festival. Wu studied with renowned artists Maurice Gendron, Paul Tortelier, Zara Nelsova, Tanya Remenikova, Leslie Parnas, and David Zinman. Presently a Distinguished Professor and Dean of the School of Music at Soochow University, Dr. Wu has held professorships at several institutions in the U.S., and previously a cello professor at the Shanghai Conservatory. He has given masterclasses at numerous institutions in North America and Asia, and summer academies in Austria, France and Germany.
