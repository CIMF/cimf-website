Sexual harassment, whether verbal, physical, or environmental, is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.

For purposes of enforcing this policy, sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome or unwanted conduct of a sexual nature (verbal or physical) when: 1.) submission to or rejection of this conduct by an individual is used as a factor in decisions affecting hiring, evaluation, promotion, or other aspects of employment, education, or performance; and/or 2.) this conduct interferes substantially with an individual’s employment, education, or performance; and/or 3.) this conduct creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment in which to work, learn, teach, or perform.

Examples of sexual harassment include, but are not limited to: unwanted sexual advances; demands for sexual favors in exchange for favorable treatment or continued employment; repeated sexual jokes, flirtation, advances, or propositions; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; graphic or verbal commentary about an individual’s body, sexual prowess, or sexual deficiencies; leering, whistling, touching, pinching, assault, coerced sexual acts, or suggestive, insulting, obscene comments or gestures; and display of sexually suggestive objects or pictures.

Individuals who believe they have been subjected to sexual harassment should report the incident to one of the following CIMF staff

Such relationships may adversely affect the teacher/student relationship and give rise to conflicts between personal and professional interests. Furthermore, no staff or faculty member should be in a supervisory position (including teaching and coaching) over a staff member or student with whom they have had a previous relationship.

Pre-existing relationships of this nature should be disclosed to the CIMF committee upon receipt of their letter of agreement (or prior) in order to determine and resolve any potential conflicts between their employment and the relationship with a student of the CIMF.
